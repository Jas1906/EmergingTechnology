3. Edge Computing for Decision Support:
    - Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the location where it is needed. In traditional cloud computing, data is processed in centralized data centers, often located far from the end-users or devices that generate or consume the data. Edge computing, on the other hand, shifts some of this processing and storage to the "edge" of the network, closer to the source of data generation. This approach offers several advantages, especially in scenarios where low latency, bandwidth optimization, and real-time processing are critical.
    - Technology Description: Edge computing involves processing data closer to its source, reducing latency and enhancing real-time capabilities. By deploying edge computing solutions, the decision support team can automate data gathering processes on the farm, leveraging IoT sensors. This enables faster data analysis and the delivery of interactive reports directly to farmers' devices.
    - On-Farm Data Processing: Edge computing involves processing data closer to its source, eliminating the need to send all data to a central server. This allows the decision support team to conduct initial data analysis directly on the farm, reducing latency and speeding up the reporting process.
    - Real-Time Reporting: By leveraging edge computing, decision support reports can be generated in real-time, providing farmers with instant access to meaningful insights. This addresses the issue of delayed reports and enhances the overall usefulness of the information.
    - Integration with IoT Devices: Edge computing seamlessly integrates with IoT devices, allowing for a more efficient and connected data gathering process. This integration enables a transition from manual measurements to automated, sensor-driven data collection.
    - Potential Impact on RegenTech: Implementing edge computing in decision support can streamline data collection, shorten the reporting timeline, and provide farmers with more interactive and meaningful insights. This addresses farmers' concerns about the timeliness and interactivity of the data they receive.
